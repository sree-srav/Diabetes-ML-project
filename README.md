Predicting 30-Day Readmission Risk in Diabetic Patients

This project focuses on using predictive analytics to identify hospitalized diabetic patients at high risk of 30-day readmission. The goal is to support healthcare decision-making by highlighting key factors associated with readmission and demonstrating how machine learning models can be applied to clinical data.

The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model development using a Gradient Boosting Classifier. Multiple patient-level variables were analyzed to identify patterns contributing to readmission risk. Model performance was evaluated using standard classification metrics to assess predictive capability.

This repository contains the Python code used for data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and feature importance analysis. The project is intended for educational and analytical purposes and does not represent a deployed clinical decision support system.

Tools & Technologies:
